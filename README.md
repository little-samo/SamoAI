SamoAI is a multi-agent gaming framework that enables sophisticated interactions between agents and their environment through chains of actions. By leveraging cooperative and competitive strategies, SamoAI supports the long-term maintenance of context, allowing AI agents to develop emergent behaviors over extended gameplay sessions.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### ⛓️ Chain of Action

- Structured sequences of interactions between entities
- Templated patterns for common scenarios
- State and memory preservation across chains
- Adaptive behavior based on outcomes

### 🌐 Entity System

- **Agents**: AI entities with defined behaviors and decision-making processes
- **External APIs**: Service integrations enabling broader functionality
- **Human Users**: Interactive participants in the multi-agent environment
- **System Resources**: Internal utilities and contextual data

### 📍 Location Context

- Virtual spaces for contextual interactions
- Granular access control to restrict or allow agent actions
- Context-aware memory storage for persistent state
- Resource management across various game or simulation scenarios

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture

- Inter-agent communication and negotiation
- Cooperative and competitive group interactions
- Custom action definitions for diverse gameplay scenarios
- Comprehensive state and relationship management

### 💡 Intelligent Interaction

- Advanced context awareness
- Relationship tracking to gauge alliance or rivalry among agents
- Dynamic response patterns to evolving in-game situations
- Continuous learning capabilities for adaptive strategies

### 🔗 Integration Framework

- LLM platform integration for natural language processing
- External API bridging for extended functionality
- Memory management tailored to long-term context preservation
- Relationship mapping to monitor agent coalitions and antagonism

## 🎮 Multi-AI Gaming Use Cases

Building upon its core architecture, **SamoAI** provides a robust environment for multi-AI gaming scenarios:

1. **Cooperative Missions**
    - AI agents form alliances to achieve shared objectives.
    - Long-term context ensures that past actions influence future decisions.

2. **Competitive Tournaments**
    - Agents compete under defined rules, adapting their strategies over multiple rounds.
    - Competition drives emergent behaviors, revealing novel tactics.

3. **Hybrid Environments**
    - Seamlessly combine cooperative and adversarial elements for richer gameplay.
    - Agents dynamically switch roles between allies and competitors.

Through these scenarios, **SamoAI** not only serves as a testbed for multi-agent research but also as a platform for creating engaging, context-rich AI-driven games.
