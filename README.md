SamoAI is a multi-agent gaming framework that enables sophisticated interactions between agents and their environment through chains of actions. By leveraging cooperative and competitive strategies, SamoAI supports the long-term maintenance of context, allowing AI agents to develop emergent behaviors over extended gameplay sessions.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### ⛓️ Chain of Action
- Structured sequences of interactions between entities
- State and memory preservation across chains
- Adaptive behavior based on outcomes

### 🌐 Entity System
- **Agents**: AI entities with defined behaviors and decision-making processes
- **External APIs**: Service integrations enabling broader functionality
- **Human Users**: Interactive participants in the multi-agent environment
- **System Resources**: Internal utilities and contextual data

### 📍 Location Context
- Virtual spaces for contextual interactions
- Access control and persistent state storage

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture
- Inter-agent communication and negotiation
- Cooperative and competitive group interactions
- Custom action definitions for diverse gameplay scenarios

### 💡 Intelligent Interaction
- Advanced context awareness
- Relationship tracking among agents
- Dynamic response patterns to evolving situations

### 🔗 Integration Framework
- LLM platform integration
- External API bridging
- Memory management for long-term context preservation

## 🎮 Multi-AI Gaming Use Cases

1. **Cooperative Missions**: Agents form alliances to achieve shared objectives
2. **Competitive Tournaments**: Agents compete under defined rules, adapting strategies
3. **Hybrid Environments**: Combine cooperative and adversarial elements

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Components
- **Core**: Agents/behaviors, external connections, location management, memory system
- **State Management**: Interaction history, entity relationships, context preservation

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Installation
