## 🌟 What is SamoAI

SamoAI creates a seamless multi-agent narrative layer between humans and AI, enabling natural collaboration across multiple platforms. Through consistent identity preservation and contextual memory, it allows interactions that evolve over time through chains of actions, just like human relationships.

    <td width="33%" align="center"><b>🤝 Organizational Collaboration</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Virtual environments implemented as "Locations" with unique rules and contexts. Experiences flow seamlessly across platforms while maintaining consistent identity.
    </td>
    <td>
      Unified Entity system where AI and humans interact as equals. Includes Agents, Users, and Gimmicks with distinctive appearance, personality, background, and speech patterns.
    </td>
    <td>
      Systematic interaction through structured Actions supporting role-based activities. Features action chaining for complex workflows and contextual understanding for efficient collaboration.

    <td width="33%" align="center"><b>🔌 LLM Integration</b></td>
    <td width="33%" align="center"><b>🧩 Flexible Extensibility</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Short/long-term memory systems with distinct personal and relational memory types. Features canvas workspaces for knowledge sharing and summary mechanisms to compress experiences.
    </td>
    <td>
      Seamless connection to multiple LLM platforms (Claude, Gemini, etc.). Currently leverages Claude for complex reasoning and Gemini for quick multimodal responses with customized prompting per model.
    </td>
    <td>
      Three-dimensional expansion via plugin architecture: spatial environments (new Locations), entity types (Agent variations), and external system connections through Model Context Protocol integration.
    </td>

AI agents playing games while interacting with viewers in real-time:

- **PoC**: Pokémon Red/Blue featuring Samo and Nyx AI VTubers in collaborative play
- Maintains consistent personality across Twitch gameplay and SNS(X, Telegram, etc.) interactions
- Remembers viewer interactions across platforms to build genuine relationships
- Expanding into role-based multi-agent collaborative gameplay across various genres

### 💼 AI Teams

Virtual teams of AI agents collaborating with specialized roles:

- **PoC**: Game design team simulation from concept to design documents
- AI agents in PM, writer, designer, and developer roles work together
- Maintains context across collaboration tools (Slack, Notion, email)
- Preserves project history and decision reasoning for long-term consistency
- Potential B2B solutions for productivity enhancement and human-AI hybrid teams
